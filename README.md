The project aims to develop a comprehensive application that provides users with accurate and real-time weather data, focusing specifically on earth and soil-related information. By utilizing various APIs from NASA and other space agencies, the application serves as a crucial resource for individuals and organizations interested in understanding environmental changes, making informed decisions, and enhancing climate resilience.

Functionality: The application functions as a dashboard that aggregates and displays critical weather and environmental data. Key features include:

Real-Time Weather Data: The app provides users with current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, precipitation probability, and other relevant metrics. This information is crucial for farmers, researchers, and anyone involved in environmental monitoring.

Precipitation Probability: Users can access the likelihood of precipitation in their area, allowing them to prepare for adverse weather conditions.

User Interaction: The application allows users to input their city names and fetch the relevant data dynamically. This interactivity enhances user engagement and provides personalized insights based on location.

Future Features: Plans for future development include adding sign-in and sign-up functionalities for user accounts, integrating AI capabilities for personalized recommendations, and expanding the weather database to include historical data for better decision-making.

How It Works: The application employs a modular architecture, making it easy to integrate various data sources and functionalities. The workflow includes:

Data Retrieval: The app uses API calls to fetch real-time data from NASA’s Giovanni API and other relevant sources. By querying these APIs, it retrieves weather and soil data based on user-provided city names.

Data Processing: The received JSON data is parsed and processed to extract relevant information, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation probability. This data is then formatted for display.

User Interface: The dashboard is designed using Figma to ensure a user-friendly experience. The UI displays the retrieved data in a visually appealing manner, allowing users to quickly understand the environmental conditions.

Unity Integration: The application is developed using Unity, allowing for interactive visualizations and dynamic data presentation. Unity's capabilities enable the creation of an immersive experience that engages users beyond static information.

Benefits: The application offers several key benefits:

Enhanced Decision-Making: Users can make informed decisions based on accurate and timely weather data, particularly important for agricultural planning and disaster preparedness.

User Engagement: The interactive elements of the application, such as input fields for city names, encourage user participation and make the information more accessible.

Scalability: The modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional features and datasets, enabling continuous improvement and adaptation to user needs.

Goals: The primary goal of the project is to create a fully functional application that serves as a reliable source of weather and environmental data. Future objectives include expanding the app’s functionalities to include user accounts, AI recommendations, and a comprehensive weather database.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Unity: Used for developing the application, providing a platform for interactive data visualization and user engagement.

Figma: Utilized for designing the user interface, ensuring a seamless and appealing user experience.

C#: The primary programming language used to write the application’s logic and API integration.

APIs: Key data sources include NASA’s Giovanni API and other weather-related APIs for real-time data retrieval.

JSON: Data format used for exchanging information between the application and the APIs, facilitating easy parsing and processing.

In conclusion, this project aims to leverage advanced technology and data from space agencies to create a valuable tool for understanding and responding to environmental challenges. Through continuous development and integration of user feedback, I hope to enhance the application's capabilities and make a significant contribution to environmental awareness and resilience.
